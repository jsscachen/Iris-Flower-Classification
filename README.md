# Iris Flower Classification 

This project aims to classify Iris flower species by utilizing data on petal and sepal dimensions obtained from the [Iris Plant Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) by R.A. Fisher, from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The exploration begins with a preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by implementation of a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether an Iris flower is a Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica.
